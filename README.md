<h2 align="center">Project Description</h2>
<p align="center">This project took a quite a bit of time and effort to create. This project is my developer portfolio that future employers will be receiving. Everything is made with React and it was extremely fun to make trying to make it perfect! I've seen the improvement from my previous portfolio versus now. The difference is night and day! React has really been challenging at times but perfecting this skill can brighten the future. I've learned so many great things outside of the course that were implemented such as styled components. This feature helped me style and format my pages tremendously! Overall, in my opinion, this project is a must and extremely important to learn and tackle. I'm glad that I've gotten the chance to experience React.</p>
